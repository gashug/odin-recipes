    <p>There's something undeniably comforting about a slice of warm pumpkin cake. It's the aroma of autumn spices wafting through the kitchen, the tender crumb practically melting on your tongue, and the creamy frosting that's the perfect sweet counterpoint to the rich pumpkin flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 cups canned pumpkin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 12x18-inch sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar and oil together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth.

        </li>
        <li>Blend in pumpkin and vanilla, then beat in eggs one at a time.

        </li>
        <li>Gradually beat in flour mixture until just combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in walnuts; spread batter into the prepared sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool.

        </li>
    </ol>
